## Game Mechanics:
### Grid System:
The game world is represented as a grid, with each tile representing a specific piece of land. Players can interact with the grid by placing grass and tree machines on individual tiles.

### Grass Machine:
Grass machines are used to cover barren land with grass. Players can place grass machines on empty tiles to initiate grass growth. Once placed, grass machines gradually spread grass to adjacent tiles over time. Grass machines have three modes:
1. **Standard Mode:** Spreads grass evenly to adjacent tiles.
2. **Concentrated Mode:** Spreads grass more densely in a smaller area.
3. **Sparse Mode:** Spreads grass sparsely, covering a larger area with fewer grass tufts.

### Tree Machine:
Tree machines are used to grow trees on grass-covered tiles. Players can place tree machines on tiles that already have grass. Once placed, tree machines gradually grow trees on the same tile over time. Trees contribute to environmental restoration and add visual appeal to the landscape.
